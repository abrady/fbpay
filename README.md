fbpay
=====

example of how to do payments on facebook using react.js and parse. Clone this and:
- set up your app id in the cloud/fbconfig.js file
- set up your parse info in the cloud/parseconfig.js file

After that you should be able to build a catalog and test payments:
- host this on parse, and run fbdeploy and you should see the catalog builder (see fbpay.parseapp.com) 
- put this on facebook's canvas by setting up a facebook canvas app with your parse app as the target with /canvas, (e.g. fbpay.parseapp.com/canvas)
